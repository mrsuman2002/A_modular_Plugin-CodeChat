# General Notes
# =============
# - Issues: may Need to let user decide file storage location and allow access to said location
# 
# To Do
# =====
# - Make it so if you already have an installation exe for python the script won't download another one.
# - Support parsing multiple versions of python and using the highest version that supports codechat.
