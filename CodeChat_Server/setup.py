#
# To package
# ==========
# Create a source distribution, a built distribution, then upload both to
# `CodeChat_Server at PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CodeChat_Server>`_:
#
# .. code-block:: console
#   :linenos:
#
#   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel twine
#   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
#   python -m twine upload dist/*
#
# To create an RPM, first manually edit the ``name=`` setting to add a ``python3-`` prefix and lowercase the name (e.g. ``name=python3-codechat``, not ``name=python3-CodeChat``). Perform ``sudo dnf install python3-devel rpm-build``. Then, use (on an RPM-based Linux distribution):
#
# .. code-block:: console
#   :linenos:
#
#   python setup.py bdist_rpm
#
# For `development
# <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_:
#
# .. code-block:: console
#   :linenos:
#
#   pip install -e .[test]
